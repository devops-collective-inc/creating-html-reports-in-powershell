**Was this book helpful?** The author\(s\) kindly ask\(s\) that you make a tax-deductible \(in the US; check your laws if you live elsewhere\) donation of any amount to [The DevOps Collective](https://devopscollective.org/donate/) to support their ongoing work.

**Check for Updates!** Our ebooks are often updated with new and corrected content. We make them available in three ways:

* Our main, authoritative [GitHub organization](https://github.com/devops-collective-inc), with a repo for each book. Visit [https://github.com/devops-collective-inc/](https://github.com/devops-collective-inc/)
* Our [GitBook page](https://www.gitbook.com/@devopscollective), where you can browse books online, or download as PDF, EPUB, or MOBI. Using the online reader, you can link to specific chapters. Visit [https://www.gitbook.com/@devopscollective](https://www.gitbook.com/@devopscollective)
* On [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/u/devopscollective), where you can download as PDF, EPUB, or MOBI \(login required\), and "purchase" the books to make a donation to DevOps Collective. You can also choose to be notified of updates. Visit [https://leanpub.com/u/devopscollective](https://leanpub.com/u/devopscollective)

GitBook and LeanPub have slightly different PDF formatting output, so you can choose the one you prefer. LeanPub can also notify you when we push updates. Our main GitHub repo is authoritative; repositories on other sites are usually just mirrors used for the publishing process. GitBook will usually contain our latest version, including not-yet-finished bits; LeanPub always contains the most recent "public release" of any book.
